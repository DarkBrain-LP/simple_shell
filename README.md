# 0x16. C - Simple Shell

This project is an implementation of the shell created as the final project for the C code sprint at **ALX Africa**.

## Description :e-mail:
This is a shell written in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).
It is based on [the Thompson Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_shell).

## Installation :wrench:
Clone the below repository and compile the files into an executable using the GCC compiler.
```
https://github.com/charlesdzadu/simple_shell.git
```
##Environment :evergreen_tree::evergreen_tree:

Our shell was built and tested on  Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

### Basic usage :bulb:
- First, [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).
- Then [clone it to your local machine](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Create an executable by running the following command:
- `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh`
- From there, type in the following command and press your enter button.
- `./hsh`
- Final step: ENJOY!

## Example :computer:
```
ls -l
```
